ever wanted to control your cursor with your feet? no? well, now you can!
<!-- TODO: nice image of the thing --><p>
designing keyboards with integrated cursors, while something that i think
should be done by default, is annoying &mdash; especially when the keyboard in
question is a descendent of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">the extraordinary cluster
keyboard of the &lsquo;90s</a>. so i figured &ldquo;hey, why don't i just
sidestep the entire problem and utilize another limb?&rdquo; thus the
<b>lowball</b> was born.<span
class="sidenote"><small>
	the name was the result of a bit of back and forth with a friend,
	because the obvious name (&ldquo;football&rdquo;) is funny but
	ungoogleable and &ldquo;<span class="sj-attr">pedoball just doesn't
	have the same ring to it.</span>&rdquo;
</small></span>

<h2 id="ball">the ball</h2>

my main keyboard is (as of this writing in jan &lsquo;25) a charybdis
nano,<span class="sidenote"><small>
	from the excellent quentin lebastard of <a
	href="https://bastardkb.com/">bastardkb</a>. if you're not yet ready
	for a cluster keyboard but want to take a wild leap in the right
	direction, i highly recommend it. or another dactyl-style board, but
	this one worked well for me long before i had a 3<sc>d</sc> printer.

which has an integrated thumb trackball. i had changed the trackball from the
original iridescent red plastic ball to a vinegar-etched steel ball bearing of
the same diameter (a mod i heartily recommend!), and so resolved to try a steel
ball again for this project.

<p>
however, a 76.2 mm diameter steel ball is a <i>bit</i> heavier than a 38 mm one
(read: nearly 2 kg), so i opted to go with a lighter, but still unusual,
option: wood.

<h2 id="cluster">the key cluster</h2>

with my right foot attended to, my attention turned to my left. perhaps i could
offload the entirety of mouse functionality to my feet with a couple of keys?

<p>
so i did. this was mostly a process of mapping out how each part of my foot
could move (inspired by the muscle <i>&amp;</i> tendon architecture therein),
then making prototypes which attempted to reflect that. i also wanted to be
able to step into and out of the cluster without much difficulty.

<!-- TODO: write about the multiple cluster drafts, with photos -->

<h3 id="cluster-1st">first draft</h3>

i initially cooked up the following scheme: one key for the ball of the foot,
up and down keys for the hallux,<span
class="sidenote"><small>
	i love this word. delighted to find it. unfortunately, the alternate
	name for the ball of the foot is metatarsalgia, which is much less
	poetic.
</small></span>
and two side keys (most easily actuated by rolling the foot to the side, i
discovered). all switches were magnetically actuated cardboard-hinged
electrical contact switches, created by running thin copper tape over magnets
embedded in the keys.<span
class="sidenote"><small>
	more on these switches... elsewhere.
	<!-- TODO: actually write about them elsewhere lol -->
</small></span>
this scheme worked, but required the user to gingerly insert their foot into
the cluster, rather than being able to blind-stomp into it.

<h3 id="cluster-2nd">second draft</h3>

improvements were wanted. specifically:
<ol>
	<li>
		no connected hinges, so there would be no hinge to wear out,
	</li>
	<li>
		different magnet weights (most were too heavy), and
	</li>
	<li>
		perhaps optical switches for controllable nonzero pretravel and
		reliability.
	</li>
</ol>
fortunately, by the second draft i had access to the svalboard design files!
which were less illuminating than i might have expected, but provided
confirmation that a delicious free-floating magnetic hinge was not too
difficult to design.
