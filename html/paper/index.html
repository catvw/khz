			i have been playing with paper for a <i>long</i> time,
			since i picked up wireframe modular origami around
			2011. it remains one of my most beloved materials, and
			i have some particular thoughts on it (and adjacent
			media).

			<h2 id="notebooks">notebooks</h2>

			i usually bind my own, ever since learning to do so in
			2019. the signatures are simple printer paper (as far
			from glossy as practical), as i like completely blank
			surfaces, and the covers are designed to permit them to
			lie flat on every page.
