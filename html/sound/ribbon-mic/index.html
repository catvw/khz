last september (as of jan &lsquo;25), in a fit of pique, i sliced my modmic off
its cable, then designed and built a ribbon microphone as a replacement.

aside from some background hum, unavoidable since the ribbon-to-return-wire
loop has nonzero area and i can't magnetically shield it myself, this device
sounds (subjectively) like a studio mic.

	this was <i>not</i> rigorously tested in the least! i'm no expert on
	frequency response verification of microphones (and don't have an
	anechoic chamber to do it in, anyway). if you have reliable (and
	cheap?) techniques for mic analysis, let me know!

	oh, also: this page was written well after the fact, and so contains

<h3 id="how-it-works">how a ribbon works</h3>

a ribbon mic motor (the term for the bit that picks up sound) consists of a
gossamer-thin strip of corrugated aluminum slung loosely between two powerful
magnets (or, equivalently, ferrous pole pieces). when sound reaches the motor,
the ribbon bends along the corrugations &mdash; which moves it across the
magnetic field it's sitting in, generating a small potential across the ribbon
which runs off to the preamp.

electrically, physically, relatively simple. but there are three main problems
you run into (well, i ran into) when trying to actually build one:
<ol>
	<li>
		the signal out of the ribbon is tiny: i wound up with a
		relatively high-output ribbon, which provides about 200 &mu;Vpp
		when i speak assertively into it. this is easily swamped by
		electrical noise, if you happen to live in an electrically
		noisy apartment.

		<span class="sidenote"><small class="note-contents">
			<span class="sc">ham</span>s will look at me like i'm a
			wuss... which, basically, i am: microvolts can
			absolutely be amplified without a lot of noise.
			<i>however,</i> for a ribbon mic, you have to do so
			across three decades of bandwidth and can't selectively
			filter out line hum because it's within your target
			band. <a href="https://artofelectronics.net/">horowitz
			<i>&amp;</i> hill</a> have a good treatise on how to
			build an amp that can pull this off, provided you have
			sufficient shielding (which i don't).
		</small></span>
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon itself is <i>exceedingly</i> delicate: modern ribbon
		mics use 2.5 &mu;m or 6 &mu;m aluminum for the ribbon, which
		breaks very easily. those foil gauges are not particularly
		available, either, so i had to make do with something even
		worse. more on that later.
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon has very low resistance (around 200 m&Omega; for
		mine). this may seem like a good thing, but it means that the
		<i>slightest</i> stray resistance in the ribbon mounting setup
		will appreciably decrease your output if you have a reasonably
		well-matched preamp. this is probably the least problematic of
		the three, though.
	</li>
</ol>
all that to say: i did not realize quite what i had gotten myself into when i
cut my mic cable. ah well.
