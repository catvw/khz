last september (as of jan &lsquo;25), in a fit of pique, i sliced my modmic off
its cable, then designed and built a ribbon microphone as a replacement.

		transformer in view. who needs a pop filter?

aside from some background hum, unavoidable since the ribbon-to-return-wire
loop has nonzero area and i can't magnetically shield it myself, this device
sounds (subjectively) like a studio mic.

	this was <i>not</i> rigorously tested in the least! i'm no expert on
	frequency response verification of microphones (and don't have an
	anechoic chamber to do it in, anyway). if you have reliable (and
	cheap?) techniques for mic analysis, let me know!
