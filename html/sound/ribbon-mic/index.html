last september (as of jan &lsquo;25), in a fit of pique, i sliced my modmic off
its cable, then designed and built a ribbon microphone as a replacement.

aside from some background hum, unavoidable since the ribbon-to-return-wire
loop has nonzero area and i can't magnetically shield it myself, this device
sounds (subjectively) like a studio mic.

<h2 id="how-it-works">how a ribbon works</h2>

a ribbon mic motor (the term for the bit that picks up sound) consists of a
gossamer-thin strip of corrugated aluminum slung loosely between two powerful
magnets (or, equivalently, ferrous pole pieces). when sound reaches the motor,
the ribbon bends along the corrugations &mdash; which moves it across the
magnetic field it's sitting in, generating a small potential across the ribbon
which runs off to the preamp.

electrically, physically, relatively simple. but there are three main problems
you run into (well, i ran into) when trying to actually build one:
<ol>
	<li>
		the signal out of the ribbon is tiny: i wound up with a
		relatively high-output ribbon, which provides about 200 &mu;Vpp
		when i speak assertively into it. this is easily swamped by
		electrical noise, if you happen to live in an electrically
		noisy apartment.

		<span class="sidenote"><small class="note-contents">
			<span class="sc">ham</span>s will look at me like i'm a
			wuss... which, basically, i am: microvolts can
			absolutely be amplified without a lot of noise.
			<i>however,</i> for a ribbon mic, you have to do so
			across three decades of bandwidth and can't selectively
			filter out line hum because it's within your target
			band. <a href="https://artofelectronics.net/">horowitz
			<i>&amp;</i> hill</a> have a good treatise on how to
			build an amp that can pull this off, provided you have
			sufficient shielding (which i don't).
		</small></span>
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon itself is <i>exceedingly</i> delicate: modern ribbon
		mics use 2.5 &mu;m or 6 &mu;m aluminum for the ribbon, which
		breaks very easily. those foil gauges are not particularly
		available, either, so i had to make do with something even
		worse. more on that later.
	</li>

	<li>
		the ribbon has very low resistance (around 200 m&Omega; for
		mine). this may seem like a good thing, but it means that the
		<i>slightest</i> stray resistance in the ribbon mounting setup
		will appreciably decrease your output if you have a reasonably
		well-matched preamp. this is probably the least problematic of
		the three, though.
	</li>
</ol>
all that to say: i did not realize quite what i had gotten myself into when i
cut my mic cable. ah well.

<h2 id="mechanical">mechanical</h2>

i think this is a sensible place to start. many of the design decisions for
this mic were a direct consequence of the mechanical constraints of the
microphone, including what parts i could actually find.

<h3 id="ribbon-material">ribbon material</h3>

i decided to use imitation silver leaf (also known as signwriter's leaf, at
least to some audiophiles on the internet). it's made of nearly pure aluminum
beaten around 0.5 &mu;m thick, approxmately the same thickness as the ribbon
used in <i>very</i> early commercial ribbons. (and perhaps some modern ribbons,
though i would be surprised.)

<p>
i would have used 2.5 &mu;m 1000-grade aluminum foil, but the only quantities
easily available on the internet are small, expensive, 6-by-12 cm rectangles
sold specifically for reribboning microphones. since i had an interest in
keeping this microphone cheap and repeatable, i wanted something a little more
reliable as a source. so, naturally, i turned to alibaba. after speaking to
around eight suppliers, i found that either:
<ol>
	<li>
		they had 2.5 &mu;m foil in 8011 only, which i didn't want due
		to the increased resistivity of the alloy,
	</li>

	<li>
		they <i>said</i> they had 2.5 &mu;m foil in stock, but actually
		didn't when pressed (the majority of responses), or
	</li>

	<li>
		they could custom-make 1000-grade 2.5 &mu;m foil, but had a
		<span class="sc">moq</span> of 10 metric tons... which,
		according to a quick back-of-the-envelope a <span style="color:
		#6d41a1">friend</span> prodded me to do, is probably more foil
		than has been used in all ribbon microphones since the
		beginning of time.
	</li>
</ol>
so i had to find another source. one diyaudio thread mentioned that
signwriter's leaf had worked, though it had been finicky, so... i decided to
try that.

<i>turns out,</i> this material is a royal pain in the ass to work with.

<h3 id="corrugation">ribbon corrugation</h3>

the ribbon in the mic has to be lightly corrugated to help it both hold the
correct tension and move when under that tension. this, naturally, requires you
to corrugate the ribbon.
<span class="sidenote"><small class="note-contents">
	for some reason, i feel the need to point out that this was an attempt
	at humor.
</small></span>

<p>
the basic procedure (at least for avid hobbyists) is (a) print some
fine-pitched gears, then (b) run a cut ribbon between those gears. this works
great with 6 &mu;m foil, pretty well with 2.5 &mu;m foil, and destroys 0.5
&mu;m foil instantly &mdash; signwriter's leaf is fragile enough to break if
you're brutish enough to touch it with a finger or blow too hard at it, much
less callously mash it between coarse 3<span class="sc">d</span>-printed parts.
since i could not touch the ribbon material, i came up with a corrugation
method that does not require it. without further ado:

<h4 id="corrugation-how-to">how to corrugate signwriter's leaf</h4>
<ol>
	<li>
		superglue two sheets of printer paper together. these will form
		the sacrificial shield inside of which the leaf will live.
	</li>

	<li>
		carefully place a single sheet of leaf between the sheets of
		paper. you will have to directly handle the leaf for this...
		but fortunately do not have to do anything precise to it, so
		use cotton gloves of the sort often found alongside this leaf.
		place it approxmately square with the edges of the paper
		shield.
	</li>

	<li>
		slice the shield with a rotary paper cutter at a known width
		such that the slice cuts through the leaf. this will give an
		easy reference for getting leaf strips of the right width.
	</li>

	<li>
		shift the leaf/shield combo 5 mm (if you're me) and slice
		again. this will give you a strip of leaf sandwiched between
		two strips of paper.
	</li>

	<li>
		cut two strips of paper long enough to completely enclose the
		leaf, and as wide as the gears you're using. soak both in
		isopropyl alcohol and lay it perfectly flat on a table.
	</li>

	<li>
		remove one of the shield strips from around the leaf, press the
		leaf into the soaked strip, and carefully remove the remaining
		shield strip from the back of the leaf. press the other soaked
		strip onto the first strip. they should stick together just
		enough to allow you to pick up the sandwich, leaf inside.
	</li>

	<li>
		run the entire sandwich through the gears to corrugate it.
		don't be afraid to press hard: <span style="color:
		#6d41a1">&ldquo;the ribbon can sense fear,&rdquo;</span> and it
		takes some force to get the stack to fold enough, especially
		with fine-pitch gears.
	</li>

	<li>
		wait for the sandwich to dry. gross.
	</li>

	<li>
		once dry, carefully (i write that a lot, don't i?) peel
		the top strip of paper away, then <i>very</i> carefully
		take a pair of flat-tipped tweezers and remove the
		now-ribbon from the other strip of paper. bending the
		second strip in a curve right where the ribbon cleaves
		from it can help cajole shy ribbons into separating
		without breaking.
	</li>
</ol>
